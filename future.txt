To add: function that checks if lon and lat are represented in the data as the data is 2.5 * 2.5 degrees.  
Also need function to report back the rounded up/down lon or lat 



General Notes:
(29*65*24seconds)/60/60 #seconds/minute/hours 
# will take 12 hours to use the westerly count function on whole dataset
#Â could divide this up into 12 1 hour sessions
# each dataframe is 1kb so in total 1885kb (1.8mb)
#29*65 = 1885 cells

20-90N, 180-340W


120W = 240 longitude
140W = 220 longitude
